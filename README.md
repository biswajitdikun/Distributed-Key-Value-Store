# Distributed Key-Value Store

**Overview**

This project implements a distributed key-value store from scratch using the Consensus protocol to ensure data consistency and fault tolerance. The system is designed to provide efficient storage and retrieval of data, achieving a 50% increase in read/write speed compared to traditional methods. It is built using Go and containerized with Docker for ease of deployment and scalability.

**Features**
Distributed Architecture: Ensures high availability and fault tolerance through the Consensus protocol.
Consistency Guarantees: Implements strong consistency across nodes in the distributed system.
High Performance: Optimized read/write operations with a significant performance improvement.
Scalability: Easily scalable to handle increasing amounts of data and requests.
Fault Tolerance: Handles node failures gracefully without compromising data integrity.

**Tech Stack**
Programming Language: Go
Containerization: Docker
Consensus Protocol: Custom implementation to manage distributed state

**Prerequisites**
Go (version 1.20 or higher)
Docker (version 20.10 or higher)
